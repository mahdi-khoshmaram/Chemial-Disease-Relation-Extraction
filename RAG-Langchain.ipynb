Clayton Christensen's work is highly regarded in the business and academic communities, and \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" is considered one of his most influential books.\n","\n","In the book, Christensen argues that established companies often struggle to innovate and adapt to new technologies because of their existing business models, organizational structures, and cultural norms. He uses the term \"disruptive innovation\" to describe the process by which new technologies or business models disrupt the status quo and create new markets or opportunities.\n","\n","Christensen also introduces the concept of the \"innovator's dilemma,\" which refers to the tension that exists between the need to innovate and the need to maintain profitability. He argues that established companies often prioritize short-term financial performance over long-term innovation, which can lead to their downfall.\n","\n","The book is filled with examples of companies that have successfully innovated and adapted to new technologies, as well as those that have failed to do so. Christensen uses case studies of companies such as IBM, Digital Equipment Corporation, and Xerox to illustrate his points.\n","\n","\"The Innovator's Dilemma\" has had a significant impact on the way businesses think about innovation and strategy. It has been widely read and studied by business leaders, entrepreneurs, and academics, and has influenced the development of new business models and strategies.\n","\n","Overall, \"The Innovator's Dilemma\" is a thought-provoking and insightful book that offers valuable lessons for anyone interested in innovation, entrepreneurship, and business strategy.\n"]}],"source":["# pass context (previous question and answer) along with the follow up \"tell me more\" to Llama who now knows more of what\n","memory.save_context({\"input\": question},\n","                    {\"output\": answer})\n","followup_answer = conversation.predict(input=followup)\n","print(followup_answer)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"id":"f5303d75","metadata":{"id":"f5303d75","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716744170415,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":5112,"user":{"displayName":"mahdi khoshmaramzade","userId":"08386554965938349723"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["from langchain_community.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings\n","from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS\n","from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\n","from langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoader\n","import bs4\n","\n","loader = WebBaseLoader([\"https://huggingface.co/blog/llama3\"])\n","docs = loader.load()\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"eecb6a34","metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"eecb6a34"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50)\n","all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)\n","\n","vectorstore = FAISS.from_documents(all_splits, HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name=\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"))\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"00e3f72b","metadata":{"id":"00e3f72b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716722713373,"user_tz":-210,"elapsed":3303,"user":{"displayName":"","userId":""}},"outputId":"9d88b243-3a6f-4b95-c77a-269124048c78","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/langchain_core/_api/deprecation.py:119: LangChainDeprecationWarning: The method `Chain.__call__` was deprecated in langchain 0.1.0 and will be removed in 0.3.0.
